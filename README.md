# restaurant-page

This is a mock restaurant website built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This was built to practice using webpack
and Javascript bundling. It incorporates tabbed browsing (live tabs are the homepage logo, menu, and contact buttons)
that run JS modules when called.

This app is deployed on Github Pages on the gh-pages branch of this repo.
